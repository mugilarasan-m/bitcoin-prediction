# 📈 Bitcoin Price Prediction Dashboard

Welcome to the **Bitcoin Price Prediction** project, a real-time, interactive dashboard built using **Streamlit**. This app forecasts Bitcoin prices for the next 10 days using a powerful **ensemble of hybrid deep learning models**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This Streamlit app fetches historical Bitcoin data, processes it, and displays predictions using the following advanced models:

- **TFT-LSTM with Quantile Regression**
- **Dynamic GNN + LSTM**
- **Conditional VAE + Transformer**
- **Augmented NODE + GRU**
- **Cross-Attention Multi-Head + ConvLSTM**

These models are integrated in an **ensemble** with user-defined weights to generate robust and accurate forecasts.
